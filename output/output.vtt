00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
A year ago I interviewed at Netflix in absolutely embarrassed myself, which obviously led to a rejection.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.000
But a lot of you guys wanted to hear about that, so let's talk about it.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.320
Now, even though I didn't get the job, I hope my experience can teach you guys on what not to do.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.360
I learned a lot from it and I performed better on my other interviews after that,

00:17.360 --> 00:18.800
and I hope it helps you guys out too.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.280
Now the first thing you guys probably want to know is,

00:21.280 --> 00:24.240
how did someone like you even get to interview with Netflix?

00:24.240 --> 00:26.720
Well, the answer to that question is, I don't know.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.640
Oh, oh, what do you mean by that?

00:30.640 --> 00:32.640
I honestly don't know how I got an interview.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.000
I think it was just all luck.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.440
Netflix is a big company, so they probably let a lot of people interview.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.840
But the way it started was like all jobs.

00:39.840 --> 00:40.960
I just applied online.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.720
I applied for the new graph position since I was in my last year of college at the time.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.800
I didn't have a referral in my application.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.640
I just filled it out and called it a day.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.760
And surprisingly, only one day passed and I get an email.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.120
Next step was Netflix.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.320
What a fun surprise.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.800
When I applied, I did it as a joke because in my mind, I was like, yeah, Netflix is going to

00:58.800 --> 00:59.600
interview me.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.400
That's funny.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.840
You got the whole squad laughing.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.360
But company that only hired senior engineers at this point is going to interview

01:05.360 --> 01:06.800
some average bozo like me.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.000
That's hilarious.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.680
Now, if you don't know how the software engineer interview process goes for a lot of companies,

01:11.680 --> 01:12.960
it usually goes like this.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.800
The first step is the initial application, so you just send your resume, blah, blah, blah.

01:16.800 --> 01:21.360
The second step is an online assessment, which is just the coding test on a platform similar to

01:21.360 --> 01:22.480
the code from then.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.880
If you do good on that, you move on to a phone screen.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.160
And this is usually a technical coding interview where you'll solve some

01:28.160 --> 01:29.920
question and with an engineer at the company.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.520
And if you do good on the phone screen, you'll move on to what's called the onsite interview.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.520
This usually consists of multiple interviews and it could be one or multiple coding

01:37.520 --> 01:40.800
interviews, a system design interview, and then a behavior interview.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.720
And if you pass all of those, you get the job.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.520
It's pretty easy, right?

01:43.520 --> 01:44.240
No.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.240
Now, before some of you guys freak out and are like, oh my god, how am I going to get a job or

01:48.240 --> 01:50.560
internship, the process seems so difficult.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.640
How am I going to do this or the smart people that are like,

01:52.640 --> 01:55.040
well, not every company does it like this.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.040
Some of them have it really easy.

01:57.040 --> 01:57.600
Well, you're right.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.480
The interview process all depends on the company.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.320
Some companies have it easier.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.600
Some companies have it harder.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.960
It really just all depends.

02:04.960 --> 02:08.720
But the process for Netflix, at least for the new grab position, which I applied for,

02:08.720 --> 02:09.520
it went like this.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.920
The first step was the application, which I just did.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.840
The second step is an online assessment.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.400
The third step is a phone screen with a Netflix engineer.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.600
And then the last part is the onsite, which was three interviews,

02:19.600 --> 02:23.280
a coding interview, a system design interview, and then a behavior interview.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.600
The email I got was for the online assessment.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.600
And I think it was just an automatic response to weed out applicants before they actually

02:29.600 --> 02:30.480
check resumes.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.880
I had a few days to prepare before it expired.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.480
So I spent some time doing some leak-out questions before attempting the assessment.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.040
The assessment was done on a platform called Code Signal.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.600
And the questions were very similar to what you'd see on the code.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.720
The coding assessment had four questions that felt like leak-out

02:44.720 --> 02:45.840
easy and mediums.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.440
I only saw them through the questions.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.640
A question about metricis.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.280
Probably up.

02:49.280 --> 02:52.320
But I thought that was it because I've seen some posts online, you know,

02:52.320 --> 02:55.680
Reddit posts where people literally get a perfect score and get rejected.

02:55.680 --> 02:56.880
So I was like, well, whatever.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.280
It wasn't expecting much anyways and Netflix would not want me.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.400
So a few weeks passed and I was just in bed scrolling on TikTok,

03:02.400 --> 03:04.160
you know, being lazy, being a degenerant.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.640
And I get an email from a Netflix recruiter saying,

03:06.640 --> 03:07.680
hello from Netflix.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.920
Next steps, I cannot believe the email.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.160
I was in complete shock and disbelief.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.080
Now at this point, in my opinion, I've officially moved on to the interview process

03:16.080 --> 03:17.520
because they've checked my resume.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.240
I've done the online assessment to weed out people when I passed.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.160
And now you guys are probably wondering,

03:22.160 --> 03:24.160
well, what did your resume look like to move on?

03:24.160 --> 03:26.960
Well, in my opinion, my resume was that impressive.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.520
I had two small internships that weren't that impressive,

03:29.520 --> 03:31.360
at least to a big company like Netflix.

03:31.360 --> 03:36.400
And the personal projects I had at the time were very simple YouTube tutorial type of projects.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.400
All of them were web development projects.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.000
None of it was really unique.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.440
I didn't stand out too much.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.720
I think the projects I had were a social media clone,

03:44.720 --> 03:49.360
a blog website, and then a simple crypto website, where I just fetch data from an API.

03:49.360 --> 03:53.840
I also didn't go to some fancy prestigious school like Harvard and IT or UCLA.

03:53.840 --> 03:58.160
I went to an average state school, like when I applied to jobs and I had to answer my school,

03:58.160 --> 04:01.280
sometimes it wouldn't show up as an option and I had to select other.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.840
So yeah, I have no idea how I moved on.

04:03.840 --> 04:08.000
Now I was at the phone screen stage where I have to do an interview with the Netflix engineer.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.920
So I set up the time for the interview and started the Lee Code grind.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.480
I was on my phone in David Goggins type of grinding.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.200
I was eating Lee Code for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.280
I was talking over Dosing on Lee Code.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.880
Lee Code was running through my veins.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.600
I dreamed about Lee Code, had nightmares about Lee Code.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.400
It was serious.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.240
You could put me on a motivational video.

04:26.240 --> 04:32.160
Now I'm being dramatic here, but I think I did around 50 to 75 Lee Code problems from when I got the email

04:32.160 --> 04:33.440
to the day of the interview.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.760
I couldn't do much preparation because remember how I mentioned I had two small internships

04:37.760 --> 04:38.640
on my resume.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.080
Well, I was in the middle of that second internship and I also had class.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.200
And at the time I was taking computer vision and machine learning.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.960
And if you see the math in those classes,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.280
yeah, it's not something I could just skip on.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.400
I probably would have failed those classes if I didn't pay attention.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.320
But fast forward to the day of the interview.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.920
I was so forward nervous.

04:57.920 --> 05:02.720
I didn't have much interview experience and the thought of interviewing with a company like Netflix

05:02.720 --> 05:04.320
made it a hundred times worse.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.920
I was sweating, couldn't focus.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.040
It was just bad man.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.400
But the interview got started.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.760
The interview was done online.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.760
So I was in a Zoom call with an engineer.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.720
And we use code signal as the platform to write my code.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.360
The interview started by introducing ourselves, you know,

05:17.360 --> 05:19.840
asking me about my experience, my projects and all that.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.600
And I think I was fumbling my words a bit too since I was so nervous.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.760
But after that, they asked the coding question.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.000
The question was something you'd expect from Lee Code.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.960
And the most surprising thing about the question was that it was similar to one I've done on Lee Code.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.240
So on my head, I was just like,

05:34.240 --> 05:35.280
thankfobbing God.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.880
I won't embarrass myself at least.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.000
So I started off by explaining what I thought the problem was asking.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.720
The interviewer agreed and said I was on the right track.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.680
Cool. Then I started to explain my approach for the problem.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.920
And the interviewer was once again agreeing with me,

05:47.920 --> 05:49.520
confirming that I was on the right track.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.000
And I was treating it like a pair of programming sessions.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.040
And that's what they said.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.480
But I think it's bullshobbing.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.480
For some companies, because some of these interviews,

05:56.480 --> 05:58.480
I swear they just want you to solve the problem.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.320
Anyways, I explained my approach.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.000
And now it was time to code it up.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.520
Now here's where the problem started.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.360
And my nerves completely took over.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.720
You ever had that moment in school when you're doing an exam or a quiz?

06:08.720 --> 06:12.240
And once it starts, you just forget literally everything you learned.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.560
Yeah, that happened to me during this interview.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.360
Now even though I explained my approach to ask some questions,

06:17.360 --> 06:19.360
I just completely forgot how to code.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.480
The nerves won.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.400
My solution started with a hash map.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.440
And I chose Python as my language for the interview because I'm a soy dev.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.640
I wanted really easy.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.720
And in order to make a hash map in Python,

06:28.720 --> 06:30.960
you tend to use a dictionary or a dick.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.520
The problem was I forgot how to use a dictionary.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.760
So I basically forgot how to use my dick.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.200
You know, it happens to every developer's life where you just forget how you use your dick.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.000
Very unfortunate.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.360
So I hinted up some way,

06:41.360 --> 06:43.440
none of the most basic things with a dictionary.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.680
And look at it from the interviewers point of view, right?

06:45.680 --> 06:49.360
The person you're interviewing is someone who's done a few years of coding classes.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.880
Since it's a new grad position, right?

06:50.880 --> 06:52.400
They passed the online assessment.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.080
Their resume was good enough to make it here.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.400
But you're telling me they can't do a simple for loop.

06:56.400 --> 06:56.960
How do I?

06:56.960 --> 06:58.240
Probably did they get here.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.560
Now, unfortunately, I spent all my time stumbling on the solution.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.000
And then the interview ended just like that.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.200
I just knew that was it.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.560
It was just embarrassing, man.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.000
And the interviewer was nice.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.440
And was just like, it's all right, man.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.160
Don't worry about it.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.360
It happens to a lot of people.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.080
And that was it.

07:12.080 --> 07:15.840
The worst part about it was that literally the moment the interview ended.

07:15.840 --> 07:20.000
I decided to finish implementing my solution with the same test case that I was given.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.800
And I kid you not.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.240
In about five minutes, I coded it up without any issues.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.960
It's like all the knowledge came seeping into my head.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.080
And I was so mad.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.200
Now, a few days passed and I was disappointed with myself.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.080
Like, how could I mess up the easiest interview I probably could have ever gotten for Netflix?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.600
I saw the similar question.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.960
My approach was correct.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.960
How could I just forget how to code?

07:40.960 --> 07:44.400
But I get an email from the Netflix recruiter and the email says,

07:44.400 --> 07:45.440
congratulations.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.960
You're moving on to the next steps.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.560
And I was so fubbly excited.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.920
I was so happy.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.120
It was crazy, man.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

07:52.080 --> 07:52.960
I'm just kidding.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.160
I just got a fubbly objection letter.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.160
Obviously, you thought it was going to be a happy ending.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.520
I'm not the main character here.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.720
I was just a side character who finally died for a couple of months.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.640
And even if I did move on, I would have had to do a system design interview.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.040
And if I did that interview, I probably would have gotten banned from ever applying to Netflix again.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.120
I never studied anything about system design, so I had no idea what to do there.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.160
So I probably got saved from embarrassing myself even more.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.640
Now, while in the interview guide I got from Netflix,

08:18.640 --> 08:21.840
they said they care about your problem solving, but at the end of the day,

08:21.840 --> 08:22.880
it's a coding test.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.200
If you can't code it, why should you pass?

08:25.280 --> 08:27.920
Now, after this interview, even though it was a fail,

08:27.920 --> 08:29.280
I definitely learned a lot.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.040
I learned how to control my nerves better,

08:31.040 --> 08:33.040
make sure I knew my coding fundamentals,

08:33.040 --> 08:35.200
and improved how I managed my time during the interview.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.480
So here's my advice for you guys, so that it doesn't happen to you too.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.080
Don't let your nerves take over.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.480
I know it's really hard, but really try your best.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.680
Don't spend a majority of your time just talking about the solution.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.040
They're here to see you code.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.000
Now, it's perfectly fine to talk while you're coding,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.760
since it helps the interviewer see your approach while you're writing the code.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.160
But don't just talk and don't just code.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.440
Try to do both of them.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.160
My next piece of advice is try to get a solution.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.760
It doesn't have to be optimal.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.840
Just try to get some type of solution.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.960
In my last piece of advice, of course, don't forget how to use your dick.

09:06.960 --> 09:07.920
It's just embarrassing.
